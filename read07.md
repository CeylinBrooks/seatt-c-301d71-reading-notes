In reading the "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team" it seems that Julia Rozovsky was having a simlair struggle in the beginning to what I went through in finding my way into coding.

Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis.

The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise.

2D Scale Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element.

2D Translate The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.

for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

In reading "Rethinking the Work-Life Equation", I really beign to wonder about why we work the way that we do. I feel as though it so easy to get burnt out by working because the expectation in how we have,as a society have a decided to work.
