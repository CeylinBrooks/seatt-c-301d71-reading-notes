What is SQL? SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

Select query for a specific columns SELECT column, another_column, … FROM mytable;

Select query with constraints SELECT column, another_column, … FROM mytable WHERE condition AND/OR another_condition AND/OR …;

More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords (ie. num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2).
